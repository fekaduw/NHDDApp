The objectives of M&amp;E are to improve the management and optimum use of the resources of a Program and to make timely decisions to resolve constraints and/or problems of implementation.</p>\n<p>The key elements for successful program management and implementation are the designing of a Program built on a hierarchy of objectives, targets, activities and measurable indicators. The agreed indicators are the most important management tools for monitoring, review and evaluation purposes. Indicators are always directly linked to the objective setting of a Program.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Health Management Information System (HMIS), which draws its data from routine service and administrative records, provides an ideal source for indicators that are reviewed frequently to monitor and refine program implementation. Reform of M&amp;E and reform of HMIS are closely linked.</p>\n<p>In order to improve M&amp;E, the monitoring and evaluation system is designed as part of the Policy, Planning and M&amp;E Process and will be implemented at all levels of the health system. A single results-based framework with a small number of indicators to make the monitoring and evaluation process effective and efficient will be agreed for the national level M&amp;E system.</p>\n<p>This document on indicator definitions covers Technical Area 1 as described in the Introduction to HMIS/M&amp;E Technical Documentation.  This document contains 2 sections: a brief introduction to the role of HMIS indicators in the broader context of indicators used to monitor and evaluate health sector performance, and definitions and guidelines for interpretation of HMIS indicators.  Two annexes are also included: one is a table of indicators, showing their frequency and level of collection; the second is a table with supplementary and alternative indicators.</p>\n<p>The 122 HMIS indicators are divided into eight major categories based on the HSDP IV Strategic objectives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C1.

These core indicators for action-oriented M&amp;E come from routine service and administrative records through HMIS.  HMIS and M&amp;E are complementary processes; reforming one means reforming the other.</p>\n<p>Four technical areas have been identified for documentation of standards for the reformed HMIS/M&amp;E.  These four areas are developed with several consultations with managers and program officers at different levels.    Reliable and timely supply of these indicators requires consistent information collection instruments and procedures.  Use of the information to improve performance requires the effective application of M&amp;E principles and guidelines.  Standards, guidelines, and implementation procedures have been laid out for each of these areas in a series of documents on HMIS / M&amp;E Technical Standards.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Indicator definitions: <em>HMIS / M&amp;E Redesign Technical Standards: Area 1</em><br />\nIncludes indicator definition, interpretation, method of calculation, and data source.</li>\n<li>Disease classification and case definitions: <em>HMIS / M&amp;E Redesign Technical Standards: Area 2</em><br />\nIncludes classification of diseases to be reported through HMIS using the International Disease classification 10 (ICD 10).</li>\n<li>HMIS Data Recording and Reporting Procedures: <em>HMIS / M&amp;E Redesign Technical Standards: Area 3</em><br />\nIncludes procedures and formats for recording medical information during client/patient encounters and for reporting and transmitting HMIS data.  These tools are based on the indicator definitions and disease classification established in the first two technical documents.</li>\n<li>HMIS / M&amp;E Information Use Guidelines and Display Tools: <em>HMIS / M&amp;E Redesign Technical Standards: Area 4</em><br />\nIncludes guidelines for self-assessment by individuals and health institutions, as well as externally assisted performance monitoring such as supervision, participatory review, and dissemination.  Guidelines for visual presentation of information are also included.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Three overarching principles have guided the redesign of these technical standards.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standardization.</strong> Common definitions of indicators, data collection instruments, and data processing and analysis procedures form the foundation for effective HMIS/M&amp;E.  Without consistent principles and definitions performance cannot be systematically measured and improved across locations or over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Integration.</strong> A single HMIS/M&amp;E plan, shared by all partners, is a cornerstone of HSDP III &amp; IV.  Implementation of this principle requires integrating data from different programs into a shared channel from which all derive their information.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplification.</strong> Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting only the information that is immediately relevant to performance improvement makes best use of scarce resources, especially human resources.</li>\n</ul>"}, "active_concepts": 122, "updated_on": "2016-11-08T13:12:49.750", "owner_type": "Organization", "external_id": ""}, "active_mappings": 0, "active_concepts": 122, "version_url": "/orgs/EthiopiaNHDD/sources/HMIS-Indicators/v2014-03/", "sourceUrl": "/orgs/EthiopiaNHDD/sources/HMIS-Indicators/", "previousVersionUrl": "/orgs/EthiopiaNHDD/sources/HMIS-Indicators/HEAD/", "parentVersionUrl": null, "concepts": [{"type": "Concept", "uuid": "5824be62fc6b9000075d4981", "id": "C1.1.1.1", "external_id": null, "concept_class": "Indicator", "datatype": "Numeric", "display_name": "Contraceptive acceptance rate", "display_locale": "en", "names": [{"uuid": "42d624cf7f5b462f831a79f43f043f49", "external_id": null, "name": "Contraceptive acceptance rate", "locale": "en", "locale_preferred": true, "name_type": "Fully Specified", "type": "ConceptName"}], "descriptions": [{"uuid": "453aa9941e824becaad4b374899e8bcb", "external_id": null, "description": "The proportion of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who are not pregnant and are accepting a modern contraceptive method (new and repeat acceptors).
